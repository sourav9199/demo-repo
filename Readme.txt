You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.
A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:

What the project does
Why the project is useful
How users can get started with the project
Where users can get help with your project
Who maintains and contributes to the project
